Thanks [GIPHY](http://giphy.com), you're great! I want better versions of your screensaver and TV stuff though.

Open up `index.html` in your browser. Sit back and melt your brainz.

### Controls

- `mouse click`: Next gif
- `right arrow`: Next gif
- `space`: Pause/play
- `escape`: Close/open dialog

By default it queries giphy for `psychedelic` gifs, but you can change this with the `q` query string param, e.g. `index.html?q=wtf`.

### Things I'd like to implement

- Connect to your account and:
    - Favorite (and downvote/blacklist?) gifs
    - Play from favorites
- A prettier UI
- Play from multiple tags
- Move to previous
- Browser back/forward buttons and touch swipe to move prev/next
