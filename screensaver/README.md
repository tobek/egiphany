I used <https://github.com/tlrobinson/WebSaver> to create a screensaver from `index.html`, but the repo isn't really maintained so there were a bunch of issues along the way and I forget how I fixed it, so no xcodeproj here. However, `Egiphany.saver` should work as a screensaver on OS X El Capitan.

It's hardcoded to the `psychedelic` search query - you can modify `Contents/Resources/index.html` (right click on `Egiphany.saver` -> Show Package Contents) and then re-install the screensaver of if you like.

Might want to try <https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver> instead.
